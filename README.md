# Product-Demo-Site
I created this websited for a local outlet in order to promote their new launched product which is Microsoft Studio. The website has been designed using only black and white color combinations. Images and the descriptions are adopted from the Microsoft studio official website. In additions to the design the website behaves live when scrolling down with some awesome scrolling effects which I have given using ScrollReveal sippets.
